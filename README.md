UjumbeSMS
=========

UjumbeSMS is a continuation of EnvayaSMS, whose purpose was to act as an SMS and MMS gateway. The original EnvayaSMS project has not been updated in over two years, and UjumbeSMS's goal is to bring EnvayaSMS to more recent Android builds, utilizing the new Android paradigms and requirements.

This project was built using the Android SDK Bundle at

### Requirements

UjumbeSMS requires the use of the AndroidBits Library, which can be found at

Please put a symlink to the AndroidBits library next to your UjumbeSMS project folder (or download it to there), so it can easily be referenced across platforms via ../AndroidBits
